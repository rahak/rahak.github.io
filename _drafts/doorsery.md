# Context
Doorsery is a grocery ordering and delivery company based out in Rajumhundry,India. It started out as a whatsapp business and took a jumpstart during covid-19 lockdowns. With increased conversion rate and whatsapp's chat based interface creating more problems with user quirks Doorsery needed new business logic and customer experience.

# Problem
As Doorsery uses Whattsap as it's medium for e-commerce, chat is the main interface.
Due to user quirks order taking is getting clumsy.
