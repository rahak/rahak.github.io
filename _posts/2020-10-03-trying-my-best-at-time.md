This blog is difficult to maintain. Looking for an easier yet custom designable blogging platform was difficult. With many alternative routes available, I was confused about what to choose. I heard about Bludit from [Keyaar](http://keyaar.in/). Right now he is using it. Bludit's documentation is poor and not for beginners. But it's giving me an opportunity to learn code. starting with html, css and rest is all blurry not so easy. But I got a hang of digital publishing.

Although I am not a serious "blogger", I would like to have a digital archive. I think this serves me a way to keep track of time. These days memory is the first thing to lose. So started to transfer a lot of scribbles from here and there.
I think I am more concerned about how I write than what I write (for now).
