To exhibit is to open up, put yourself out, to get naked.
Yourself is out for the reader to annotate. The Graphic design exhibit by the GD'24 was one such event. where they made their thoughts hang on walls, lay on tables and move frame by frame with speed of 24 frames per second. Very bold mind map of A was a ride through a narrative (paths of thoughts and ideas connected by line of black guiding the viewer through every corner of humour). Helga’s archive of women in Iceland was a wall of photograph’s of women, their representation in folklore and their role in society. Her question “why couldn’t she name her daughter after her or no one?” Was a question of liberty. But liberty for H? Her daughter or will this question the freedom of women in Iceland? Well, the form of exhibiting thoughts have that effect. And then Pictures supported by blocks of wood catch your attention not because of the pictures but how the long vertical blocks of wood seem to be placed diagonally to the ground, interrupting the space and making you read whats written on them like the falling script of Japanese or is it? We can never see completely what the wooden blocks are supporting until unless by mistake you move them to see what the picture is hiding (not recommended, you will look like a fool—I did, I saw an affordance in the the blocks that were supporting the picture wanting me to lift them) I felt a need to see the hidden picture..
