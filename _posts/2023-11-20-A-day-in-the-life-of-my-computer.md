Hello world, I am Karthik's Computer. He calls me *Hohenheim* to communicate with web and other computers. I am mostly not placed on desk, I think he likes me to be used on his lap and he doesn't use me sitting. Sometimes I cry for help at nights when he kicks me in the bed and I fall. I got many dents and scratches. I am occasionally opened up by him than apple professionals as karthik thinks he has the knowledge of repairing from [ifixit](!https://www.ifixit.com/). He did put a lot of thermal paste and fried some parts. He enjoys tweaking me and finding hacks to make more use of me, I swear its so annoying to have a SD card permanently installed to increase storage is so annoying. 

I hold his unfinished work, his memories, notes and data. We possess each other. But I think I he haunts me more than I haunt him. If he looses me he will feel tensed and confused. I think he secretly wishes to have his brain connect to me. He is still in the process of unleashing my complete potential. He sometimes thinks of the unused keys on my keypad, tries to find ways or contexts to use them. He often thinks of ways to accomplish tasks with using as less power as possible. But still has many opened tabs on his browser! Most of the days he only hunts for esoteric programmes on the internet, looking for things that don't exist anymore. 

I sometimes wish he would only collaborate with me and not replace me for a second-hand Thinkpad with linux. I don't understand why does a graphic designer even think of linux or Open source when I exist. He never complains about how I am, but he is very critical about what softwares and updates. He thinks of a personal utopia where he could build/find better knowledge management tools, But he isn't satisfied with any. 

I wish we had more time with the workshop. as I would want to see what I can do with these tools and exercises in my work or my way of looking at things. It helped me see how I could be comfortable with working with people and break away from my ego. I don't have exact words to say what this workshop is, but I felt what it does with my mind and body together. From walking in Tartu looking at the old and new machines and being mindful about gestures. And failing together in experiments. It was fun and serious.
